<section>
  <div class="container">
    <h2>What is WCUP?</h2>
    <p>
      WCUP is a community-driven meme coin inspired by football —
      the most universal sport on the planet.
      In a world divided by borders, languages and beliefs,
      football reminds us that emotion is universal.
    </p>
    <p>
      WCUP is more than just a token; it’s your VIP pass to the
      world’s largest digital stadium. Born from the passion that
      halts the planet every four years, this project merges vibrant
      meme culture with the adrenaline of the World Cup. While the
      market chases utility, we deliver belonging: a decentralized
      economy where every holder is a loyal fan.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an ecosystem focused on community engagement and rewards tied
      to sporting excitement, WCUP transforms pitch-side hype into digital assets. 
      Whether through a clinical dribble or a strategic trade, our goal is to
      unite billions of hearts under a single crypto banner.
      In WCUP, victory is collective and the match never ends.
      Lace up your boots: the future of football is on-chain.

<!-- SOCIAL IMPACT -->
<section>
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Football Can Change Lives</h2>
    <p>
      WCUP supports sport as a tool for social transformation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Future initiatives aim to help underprivileged communities
      with sports equipment and opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
Football Can Change Lives
WCUP believes that football is the world’s most powerful tool for social transformation.
Beyond being just a game, it is a catalyst for hope that teaches discipline, resilience, and leadership. 
Our mission extends beyond the digital realm: we are committed to "leveling the playing
field" for underprivileged communities. Our future initiatives will focus on:
    </p>
    <div class="values">
 <div> Access to Sports: Distributing essential sports gear—balls, cleats, and kits—to
remove the financial barriers that keep talent from flourishing.
 <div> Opportunity and Education: Supporting after-school programs that use football
as a "hook" to steer youth away from violence and toward personal development.
 <div> Real Inclusion: Creating safe spaces where children from all backgrounds
can develop vital life skills and physical health.
    </p>
    <p>
At WCUP, every transaction helps kick inequality out of the game. We are playing for a legacy that lasts long after the final whistle.
