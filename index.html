    <h1>WCUP</h1>
    <h2>Football before tokens. People before numbers.</h2>

    <!-- INTRO -->
    <section>
      <p>
        Football is one of the few things on Earth capable of uniting millions
        of people in the same emotion at the exact same moment.
        When the ball starts rolling, borders fade, languages disappear
        and what remains is feeling.
      </p>

      <p>
        WCUP was born from this shared experience.
        Not as a speculative project.
        Not as a promise of profit.
        But as a community built around what football truly represents:
        culture, memory, belonging and humanity.
      </p>

    <!-- PURPOSE -->
    <section>
      <h3>Why WCUP exists</h3>

      <p>
        Football has always been more than a game.
        It carries stories of struggle, hope, identity and unity.
        From dusty neighborhood pitches to the greatest stadiums in the world,
        football connects people like nothing else.
      </p>

      <p>
        WCUP exists to create a space where people come together first as humans,
        inspired by football — and only later think about technology.
      </p>

      <p><strong>WCUP is:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>A growing global community inspired by football</li>
        <li>A space for stories, memories and shared experiences</li>
        <li>An experiment in building something slowly and honestly</li>

      <p><strong>WCUP is not:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>A get-rich-quick scheme</li>
        <li>A speculative or hype-driven project</li>
        <li>A closed initiative with private agendas</li>

    <!-- STATUS -->
    <section>
      <h3>Current phase</h3>

      <p>
        WCUP is currently in its <strong>community-building phase</strong>.
        There is no token launch date.
        There is no price discussion.
      </p>

      <p>
        We believe that strong communities come before any technology.
        Everything will be built slowly, transparently and together.
